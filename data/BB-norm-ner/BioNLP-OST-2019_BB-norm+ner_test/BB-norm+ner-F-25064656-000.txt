However, 96.3 and 97.9%
 of the total microbiota of the raw milk and pasteurized cheese rind, 
respectively, were composed of species present in both types of cheese, 
such as Corynebacterium casei, Psychrobacter spp., Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, Staphylococcus equorum, Vagococcus salmoninarum, and other species present at levels below 5%. Brevibacterium linens
 were present at low levels (0.5 and 1.6%, respectively) on the rind of 
both the raw and the pasteurized milk cheeses, even though this 
bacterium had been inoculated during the manufacturing process. 
Interestingly, Psychroflexus casei, also described as giving a 
red smear to Raclette-type cheese, was identified in small proportions 
in the composition of the rind of both the raw and pasteurized milk 
cheeses (0.17 and 0.5%, respectively). In the heart of the cheeses, the 
common species of bacteria reached more than 99%. The main species 
identified were Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, Psychrobacter spp., and Staphylococcus equorum ssp. equorum.
