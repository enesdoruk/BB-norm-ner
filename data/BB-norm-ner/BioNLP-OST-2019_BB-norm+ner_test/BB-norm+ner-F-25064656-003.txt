Originally, Herve cheese was made from raw milk. Later, for safety reasons due to the potential presence of Listeria monocytogenes, Herve cheese made from pasteurized milk was developed.The
 dominant microbiota present on red-smear cheeses such as Maroilles, 
Muenster, Limburger, and Pont l’Évêque has previously been described as 
being composed of gram-positive bacteria such as Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and various coryneform species such as Corynebacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Rhodococcus spp., and B. linens ( Brennan et al., 2002; Feurer et al., 2004b).
 However, the microbiota specific to Herve cheese has never previously 
been fully explored. The orange rind of the cheese is attributed to 1 
particular bacterium: B. linens.
