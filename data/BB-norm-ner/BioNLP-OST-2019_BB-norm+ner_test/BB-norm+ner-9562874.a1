T1	Title 0 133	Enterobacteriaceae found in high numbers in fish, minced meat and pasteurised milk or cream and the presence of toxin encoding genes.
T2	Paragraph 134 1567	Enterobacteriaceae were found in high numbers after storage at 7 degrees C in 6% of consumers packs of pasteurised milk or cream, in 31% of retailed fish and in 100% of retail packs of minced meat. Seventy two fresh-water fishes, 40 packs of minced meat and 430 milk packs were sampled. One hundred and eighty four isolates were randomly picked from Tryptone glucose extract (TGE) agar (30 degrees C for 3d) or Violet red bile glucose (VRBG) agar (37 degrees C for 1d). In minced meat, Serratia liquefaciens, Hafnia alvei, Rahnella aquatilis were frequently encountered. On fish, the most frequently found species were R. aquatilis, and in milk, the dominating species were S. liquefaciens, H. alvei and R. aquatilis. One to three isolates of Citrobacter freundii were found in all three food categories. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, the gene of Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (lt) was indicated in one fish isolate of R. aquatilis whereas heat-stable toxin genes (s.t.) were indicated in four H. alvei isolates, two originating from fish and two from minced meat. Positive PCR-reaction for vero cytotoxin genes were found in one H. alvei strain originating from fish (vt1), in two S. liquefaciens strains from minced meat (vt2), and in a C. freundii reference strain. One of the st-positive H. alvei strains from meat harboured the eaeA gene involved in the attaching phenotype of enteropathogenic E. coli.
