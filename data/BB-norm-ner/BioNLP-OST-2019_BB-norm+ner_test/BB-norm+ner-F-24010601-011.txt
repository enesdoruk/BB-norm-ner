The use of the strain C. maltaromaticum
 LMA28 in cheese technology and its impact on the microflora of this 
soft cheese has been demonstrated in this study. It presence caused a 
decrease in the concentration of Psychrobacter sp., which might
 be responsible for accelerating the aging phenomena of soft cheese. 
Moreover, the cellular concentration of C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 was the main factor involved in the inhibition of Psychrobacter sp. and L. monocytogenes
 CIP 82110 in our experimental conditions. However, the exact mechanism 
of inhibition is still unknown and deserves further investigations. In 
addition, C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 produced malty/chocolate-like aroma due to 3-methylbutanal from the catabolism of leucine ( Afzal et al., 2012).
 However, it is essential to study its impact on proteolysis and 
lipolysis during cheese ripening. Being psychrotrophic and 
alkalinophilic, having antibacterial activity and an ability to increase
 flavor, this species could play a major role as cheese ripening flora 
with no negative interference on the starters currently used (for 
instance S. thermophilus and L. lactis).
