One study reported the presence of Bavariicoccus seileri gen. nov., sp. nov. on the surface and in the smear water of German red-smear soft cheese ( Schmidt et al., 2009). However, this bacterium was not identified in our samples. Finally, a previous study also suggested that the color of B. linens depended on the yeast used for the deacidification of Muenster cheese ( Leclercq-Perlat et al., 2004). The presence of yeast was not, however, assessed in this study.
