Many Carnobacterium strains have been used previously as protective cultures against pathogenic bacteria (for instance Listeria monocytogenes) in fish and meat products ( Brillet et al., 2005, Duffes et al., 1999, Matamoros et al., 2009 and Vescovo et al., 2006). The bacteriocin-producing ability of Carnobacterium strains was found to play a key role in controlling spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in food and in in vitro model systems ( Dos Reis et al., 2011, Martin-Visscher et al., 2011 and Bernardi et al., 2011), while external factors, including pH, salt and storage temperatures, were also shown to have a significant impact ( Hwang, 2009 and Leroi et al., 2012).
