Although all strains of C. maltaromaticum have at least one gene encoding a bacteriocin, none of the target bacteria tested was inhibited by C. maltaromaticum
 LMA 7 and LMA 14, suggesting that the gene was not expressed in the 
culture conditions tested. The PFGE analysis showed that all the strains
 were different from each other according to the criteria of  Tenover et al. (1995), showing a diversity of this species in the same biotope.In cheese industry, two species played a major role in the milk transformation into cheese i.e. L. lactis and S. thermophilus, which acidify and coagulate milk quickly.
