T1	Title 0 116	High genetic diversity of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae isolates from two children attending a day care center.
T2	Paragraph 117 471	Twenty-one nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) isolates from the throats of two healthy children were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing. Nine unique sequence types (STs) were identified. These STs were scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of reported NTHi STs, demonstrating the high level of NTHi diversity found in colonized children.
