Carnobacterium maltaromaticum
 is a lactic acid bacterium isolated from soft cheese. The objective of 
this work was to study its potential positive impact when used in cheese
 technology. Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of six strains of
 C. maltaromaticum showed that they belong to different 
phylogenetic groups. Although these strains lacked the ability to 
coagulate milk quickly, they were acidotolerant. They did not affect the
 coagulation capacity of starter lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, used in dairy industry. The impact of C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 on bacterial flora of cheese revealed a significant decrease of Psychrobacter
 sp. concentration, which might be responsible for cheese aging 
phenomena.
