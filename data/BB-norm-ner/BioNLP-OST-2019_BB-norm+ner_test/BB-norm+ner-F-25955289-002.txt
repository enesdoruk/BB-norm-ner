More
 attention from the aged and vegetarians has been paid to soy-product 
due to its taste, easy digestibility, as well as the association with 
health. However, soy-product has a defect of low vitamin content, mainly
 the water-soluble vitamin B12. This study was to investigate co-fermentation of glycerol and fructose in soy-yogurt to enhance vitamin B12 production by Lactobacillus reuteri. After a serial combination experiments, the co-fermentation was confirmed to enhance the production of vitamin B12 up to 18 Î¼g/100 mL. Both supplementations induced the expression of cobT and cbiA
 and functioned to balance the redox reaction. Meanwhile, high content 
of fructose supplementation reduced the production of vitamin B12 and suppressed expression of cobT in bacteria. It was proved that the vitamin B12
 content of this soy-yogurt is higher than other fermented soybean based
 food and thus can be served as an alternative food for the aged and 
vegetarians.
