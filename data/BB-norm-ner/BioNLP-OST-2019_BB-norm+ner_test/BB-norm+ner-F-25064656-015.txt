Brachybacterium faecium was also identified in our study. This bacterium is close to 2 other Brachybacterium species also identified once in both French Gruyere and Beaufort cheeses ( Schubert et al., 1996).Leucobacter spp., Alkalibacterium spp., Carnobacterium spp., and Raoultella planticola, already described in milk or cheese ( Herbin et al., 1997; Ishikawa et al., 2007; Larpin-Laborde et al., 2011; Roth et al., 2011; Zadoks et al., 2011), were also identified in the raw milk cheeses in the current study.
