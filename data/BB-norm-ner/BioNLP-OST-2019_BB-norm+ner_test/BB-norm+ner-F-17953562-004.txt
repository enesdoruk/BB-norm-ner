Among the cocci the most reducing species was, by far, E. faecalis, and among the rods L. paracasei ssp. paracasei. The nonpathogen enterococci and L. lactis ssp. lactis reach Eh values of −120 and −220 mV in a very short time (about 3–4 h), while S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, species found in starter cultures, are characterized by a lower reducing power. Also the species considered as probiotics (L. paracasei ssp. paracase and L. plantarum)
 showed good reducing power.
