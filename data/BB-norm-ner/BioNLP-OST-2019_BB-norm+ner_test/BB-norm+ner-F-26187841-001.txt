Growth of the foodborne pathogen Staphylococcus aureus can be inhibited in milk and in cheese by the hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactococcus garvieae N201 dairy strain. Transcriptomic responses of two S. aureus strains, the S. aureus
 SA15 dairy strain and the MW2 human pathogenic strain, to this growth 
inhibition were investigated in Brain-Heart Infusion broth under a high 
or a low aeration level.
