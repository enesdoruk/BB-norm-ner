T1	Title 0 139	The effect of interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide on the growth of Francisella tularensis LVS in murine macrophage-like cell line J774.
T2	Paragraph 140 263	Francisella tularensis, a causative agent of human tularemia, displaying the ability to proliferate inside the human cells.
T3	Paragraph 264 440	To evaluate the growth potential of F. tularensis LVS strain in macrophage-like cell line J774 modulated by recombinant interferon gamma and E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide.
T4	Paragraph 441 712	Stimulation of J774 cells either by interferon-gamma or lipopolysaccharide alone, or especially in combination before infection F. tularensis, revealed protective effects. Higher concentrations of stimulating agents were needed to inhibit ongoing F. tularensis infection.
T5	Paragraph 713 853	Stimulation of J774 cell line by combination of interferon-gamma with lipopolysaccharide inhibits the intracellular growth of F. tularensis.
