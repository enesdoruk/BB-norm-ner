T2	Paragraph 79 1701	The mechanism(s) by which Lyme arthritis is induced has not been elucidated. In this study, we showed that macrophages have a direct, effector role in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis. Severe destructive arthritis was induced in recipients of macrophages obtained from Borrelia burgdorferi-vaccinated and nonvaccinated hamsters exposed to Formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi in vitro and then challenged with the Lyme spirochete. Swelling of the hind paws was detected within 8 h of infection, increased rapidly, and peaked at 21 h. This initial swelling decreased, and by day 4 only slight swelling was detected. Severe swelling of the hind paws was detected 8 days after infection and increased rapidly, with peak swelling occurring on day 11. Histopathologic examination affirmed that macrophages exposed to Formalin-inactivated spirochetes induced a severe destructive Lyme arthritis. The onset and severity of the severe destructive arthritis were dependent on the number of macrophages transferred. By contrast, macrophages not exposed to Formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi failed to induce severe destructive arthritis in recipients after challenge with B. burgdorferi. Similarly, severe destructive arthritis was not detected in recipients of macrophages injected with spirochetal growth medium. Our results also showed that transferred macrophages could not protect hamsters from infection with B. burgdorferi, as spirochetes were readily recovered from their tissues when cultured. These findings demonstrate that macrophages exposed to B. burgdorferi are directly involved in the induction of Lyme arthritis.
