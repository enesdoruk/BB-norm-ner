Other phylotypes were also identified in some of the samples in the present study, such as Vagococcus spp. Vagococcus salmoninarum, a species first identified from salmonid fishes and closely related to the Carnobacterium genus ( Wallbanks et al., 1990), was identified in several of the raw milk cheese samples. Vagococcus fluvialis, previously isolated from animal and human sources ( Collins et al., 1989; Pot et al., 1994; Teixeira et al., 1997) and even from cheese (Callon et al., 2014), was also identified here.It was surprising to identify the pathogenic bacteria Morganella morganii, already previously described in milk or cheese ( Tornadijo et al., 1993; Delbès-Paus et al., 2012).
 This bacterium, known to be able to produce biogenic amines such as 
histamine, has been shown to be responsible for the production of 
cadaverine in uncooked pressed cheeses (Delbès-Paus et al., 2012).Interestingly, the genus Citricoccus
 was also identified. This bacterium has never previously been 
identified in cheese, but it has been isolated several times from walls,
 especially mold-colonized walls ( Altenburger et al., 2002; Schäfer et al., 2010).
