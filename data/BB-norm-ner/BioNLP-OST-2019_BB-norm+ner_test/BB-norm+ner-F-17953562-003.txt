Considerable
 variation was found among the 10 different species tested for their 
ability to change the redox potential. The species studied in this paper
 are those most frequently present in raw milk cheeses (Enterococcus spp., Pediococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis), those used to make starter cultures (S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus), and species considered as probiotic bactera (L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and L. plantarum).
