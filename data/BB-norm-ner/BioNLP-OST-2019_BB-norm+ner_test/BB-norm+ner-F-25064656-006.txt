Phylotypes specifically identified in the raw milk 
cheese rind were mainly identified as Corynebacterium. Other phylotypes were identified as belonging to Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, or Vagococcus genera ( Supplementary Figure S1; http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-8225). On the other hand, phylotypes specifically identified in the pasteurized milk cheese rind were Psychrobacter spp., Pseudoalteromonas spp., and Vibrio spp. ( Supplementary Figure S2).
