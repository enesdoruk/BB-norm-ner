T1	Title 0 155	Mesonia algae gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel marine bacterium of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from the green alga Acrosiphonia sonderi (Kütz) Kornm.
T2	Paragraph 156 718	The taxonomic position of four heterotrophic, aerobic, Gram-negative, non-motile and moderately halophilic marine bacteria, isolated from the green alga Acrosiphonia sonderi (Kütz) Kornm, was established. 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that the strains studied are members of the family Flavobacteriaceae, in which they form a distinct lineage. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, the novel bacteria were classified as Mesonia algae gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is KMM 3909(T) (=KCTC 12089(T)=CCUG 47092(T)).
