T1	Title 0 193	Taibaiella smilacinae gen. nov., sp. nov., an endophytic member of the family Chitinophagaceae isolated from the stem of Smilacina japonica, and emended description of Flavihumibacter petaseus.
T2	Paragraph 194 1519	A light-yellow-coloured bacterium, designated strain PTJT-5(T), was isolated from the stem of Smilacina japonica A. Gray collected from Taibai Mountain in Shaanxi Province, north-west China, and was subjected to a taxonomic study by using a polyphasic approach. The novel isolate grew optimally at 25-28 °C and pH 6.0-7.0. Flexirubin-type pigments were produced. Cells were Gram-reaction-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and non-motile. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain PTJT-5(T) was a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes, exhibiting the highest sequence similarity to Lacibacter cauensis NJ-8(T) (87.7 %). The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 1 G, iso-C17 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. The only polyamine was homospermidine and the major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine. The only respiratory quinone was MK-7 and the DNA G+C content was 40.3 mol%. Based on the phenotypic, phylogenetic and genotypic data, strain PTJT-5(T) is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus in the family Chitinophagaceae, for which the name Taibaiella smilacinae gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Taibaiella smilacinae is PTJT-5(T) ( = CCTCC AB 2013017(T) = KCTC 32316(T)). An emended description of Flavihumibacter petaseus is also proposed.
