Different species of Psychrobacter
 have been isolated from various ecosystems; cold or hot, slightly or 
heavily salted, frozen sea, fish, refrigerated meat and from clinical 
samples ( Bowman, 2006). In case of cheese, this bacterium could arise either from raw milk or environmental contamination. It belongs to the order Pseudomonadales,
 well known in food microbiology as spoilage flora of dairy products 
that exhibit high proteolytic activities. It could play a role in 
accelerating the aging process of cheese. To reduce this process, C. maltaromaticum could be use as ripening flora.The study on the inhibition of the two target strains Psychrobacter sp. LMA 1 and L. monocytogenes CIP 82110, in milk predicted that the cellular concentration of C. maltaromaticum the most inhibiting factor resulted in high inhibitory growth response of Psychrobacter sp. and L. monocytogenes
 in milk. However, the combination of other variables had also an 
impact. The exact mechanism of inhibition is still unknown and deserves 
further investigations.
