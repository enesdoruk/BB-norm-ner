In addition, the presence of halophilic and alkaliphilic lactic acid bacteria was observed in the present study, such as M. psychrotolerans. This bacterium, initially isolated from marine organisms in certain areas of Japan ( Ishikawa et al., 2003), has already been previously described in cheese (Ishikawa et al., 2007) and is known to possess an anti-Listeria effect ( Roth et al., 2011). Another bacterium identified in our study of the genus Halomonas has also been reported in smear-ripened cheeses ( Mounier et al., 2005).The identification in our samples of Pseudoalteromonas was quite unexpected, as the presence of these bacteria in cheese has previously been reported only once ( Ogier et al., 2004).
