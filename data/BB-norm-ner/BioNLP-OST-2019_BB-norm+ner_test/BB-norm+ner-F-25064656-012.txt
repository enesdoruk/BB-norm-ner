Figure 6 shows that the fecal contaminant E. faecalis
 was found to be present in the raw milk cheeses (0.6%) in the present 
study but that its counts were very low in the pasteurized milk cheeses 
(less than 0.05%). These differences are mainly due to the nature of the
 milk used in raw milk cheeses, which may still be contaminated with 
bacteria that are either a source of typicality (C. casei and E. faecalis) or a microbiological hazard (E. faecalis). Usually, the most common enterococci encountered in cheese are E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, with E. faecium being the most frequently occurring species in dairy cows ( Gelsomino et al., 2002). Indeed, E. faecium was identified in our raw milk cheese samples (0.3%). In addition, Enterococcus casseliflavus, already previously described in cheese ( Gelsomino et al., 2001, 2002),
 was also detected in our samples (0.3% in raw milk cheeses and 0.1% in 
pasteurized milk cheeses).
