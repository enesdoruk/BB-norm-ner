The presence of P. celer
 has already been described previously and this bacterium contributes 
significantly to the aromatic properties of cheese, as it influences 
total volatile aroma production ( Irlinger et al., 2012). The presence of P. celer
 in the cheeses studied here may be explained by its presence in the 
saline water used in the manufacturing process. Indeed, this bacterium 
was originally isolated from seawater ( Yoon et al., 2005). Vibrio spp. have not been reported frequently in cheese ( Feurer et al., 2004a) but some studies have suggested that these bacteria could play a role in the ripening process (El-Baradei et al., 2007). Moreover, a new Vibrio species, Vibrio casei, has even been isolated from the rind of red-smear cheeses ( Bleicher et al., 2010). The presence of C. casei found in the raw milk cheeses here is not surprising, as this has already been described previously ( Mounier et al., 2005).
