In
 the conditions tested, all the strains were able to produce 
3-methylbutanal in milk cultured at 4 °C and at 30 °C after 
24 h of incubation (Table 4). Milk bottles tasted and smelled significantly differently (P < 0.05) for each Carnobacterium species after 48 h. The taste panel could clearly distinguish the milk malty flavor in bottles inoculated with C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 and lactic and aromatic flavor with LMA 14. The other strains did not exhibit particular flavors. The strain C. maltaromaticum LMA 28 was tested for cheese assay.
