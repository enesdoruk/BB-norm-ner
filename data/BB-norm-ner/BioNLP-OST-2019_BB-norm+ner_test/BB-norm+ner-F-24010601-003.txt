The presence of an opportunistic psychrotrophic LAB named Carnobacterium maltaromaticum
 has been demonstrated in numerous French cheeses (Appellation d'Origine
 Protégée, AOP = Protected Designation of Origin, PDO) at the 
end of ripening and cold storage, without affecting the final product 
quality ( Cailliez-Grimal et al., 2007 and Millière et al., 1994).
